##### Project Descriptions
*************************************

###### Short Review: 
This is a simple online restaurant project where a customer can visit the website and get large collection of food items in different categories. Once a visitor click on any of the food item, he can view all the necessary information of that food and also get an option to set the food into the cart section for father use . 

After that, the visitor can checkout the cart items but he must me login to the application before the comfirm the order. New user can signup for registering themself into the system. After comfirm the order, user can get their order history into their dashbord section. In the dashbord, user get some extra options like, he can write his opinion about the food or service quality, can update their password and many more.

There are another section for admin who have all the control over the application. Once login with special email-password an admin get access to the admin panel section,  where an admin can get the overall statistic of the activities of the application. 

In the admin dashboard, an admin can view all the order history and have a filter option according to the cuurent status of the order. In the order section, he can change the order status from processing->shipped->delivered->canceled. 

Admin can view all the users,their review also get the users complain (if any complain is registerd). Once any user register any review, admin get that notification and have the control to show or reject  that review in the testimonial section.

Admin can add different food items under different categories and also can view the existing foods items. There are some other option like update password, view or update profile and in in a nutshell admin gets all the control over the application.
